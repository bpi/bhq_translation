Memory Grid & Syllable Stacks 
=============================
The same stimulus set is used for both of these exercises. 

### Stimulus planning
The lists below are the sounds used in the English version of BrainHQ. You will need to produce an equivalent set in your language. Once you have generated a potential list of stimuli to record, please send it to Posit Science for review. Once accepted by Posit recordings can then be made. 

###Two sets of recordings required. 
We need two different voices to record the stimuli -- male and female. 

### Two  easy sound lists 
Do these last (mix in words from the hard lists). Here are the lists from the English version. You should create equivalent lists in your language. 

 - bash bill can chuck dish dust fig gash gum kiss lab mat nag nut pun rib rug sit
 - boon crags fake gone kegs lash let pab peg poke roff roop shay shob taint toe tone tube

### Four hard sound lists
Chosen to maximize total frequency of words in resulting phonological neighborhoods. About
half words, half non-words; avoid very frequent words. Each list should contain about 20 words. Here are the lists from the English version. You should create equivalent lists in your language. 

 - bake dane day nane pake pakes pape pate pay plake sane tabe tade take tame tane taned tape tave tay thay
 - bod bomb bon bons cob don dop lop nop on rob rock rop rot sob tob tom top tov trob von
 - bag cabs cacks cads cag cags cangs dat flat lad lap lat lath mag pad pag pags pang sat tag tags
 - bid big bit did dig dip gib gig kick kid kit pick pig pip pit tick tig tip
