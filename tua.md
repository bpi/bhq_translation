Fine Tuning
=============================

**We do not offer customization of sounds due to the complexity of recording new sound pairs that are matched correctly. However, we offer customization of the sound labels and you also have the option to omit some sound pairs.**

Most of these exercise offer sound contrasts that are useful in most European languages. Even if the sounds are not common in your language they are still useful for improving temporal processing speed and accuracy. 

### Customize the list
Labels: The lists below are the sounds used in the English version of BrainHQ. These are the labels used for the reponse text. You may cusomize the labels if you think different text better represents these sounds in your language. 
If there is any sound contrast pair that you believe is unusable please let us know and we will substitute with another existing one. It is best to keep this to a minimum to reduce stimulus repeats (we need to keep the grid sizes the same across the BrainHQ locales).
