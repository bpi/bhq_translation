Fine Tuning
=============================

**We do not offer customization of the auditory stimuli due to the complexity of selecting, correctly recording and processing sounds pairs. However, we do offer customization of the sound text labels.**

This exercise uses sound contrasts that are useful in most European languages. Even if the sounds are not common in your language they are still useful for improving temporal processing speed and accuracy. 

### Customize the text label list
Labels: The lists below are the sounds used in the English version of BrainHQ. These are the labels used for the response text. You may customize the labels if you think different text better represents these sounds in your language. 

#### Set 1
ga-ka  
dee-tee  
doe-toe  
gee-kee  

#### Set 2 
da-ga  
et-ek  
ud-ug  
  
#### Set 3
ad-ads  
ek-eks  
sa-sta  
  
#### Set 4 
shay-chay  
boe-poe  
  
#### Set 5
boe-doe  
ab-ad  
vo-tho   
  
#### Set 6 
bu-du  
di-gi  
bi-di  
aff-ath    

### Customize the tutorial text
You can also customize the tutorial text to include information about some of the sounds. You might want to add some text regarding unfamiliarity of the sounds. E.g., 

__Text key: aud_sound_discrimination_tut_01-0__  
You will hear one of two increasingly similar syllables and then identify which one you heard. Some of the sounds might seem unfamiliar but they are important for auditory processing.  Click on START to begin.
