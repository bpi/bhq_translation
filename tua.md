Fine Tuning
=============================

**We do not offer customization of sounds due to the complexity of selecting, correctly recording and processing sounds pairs. However, we offer customization of the sound text labels.**

Most of these exercise offer sound contrasts that are useful in most European languages. Even if the sounds are not common in your language they are still useful for improving temporal processing speed and accuracy. 

### Customize the text label list
Labels: The lists below are the sounds used in the English version of BrainHQ. These are the labels used for the reponse text. You may cusomize the labels if you think different text better represents these sounds in your language.
