Fine Tuning
=============================

**We do not offer customization of the auditory stimuli due to the complexity of selecting, correctly recording and processing sounds pairs. However, we do offer customization of the sound text labels. We also offer the option to remove sound pairs that are unworkable in your language.**

### Sound stimuli

This exercise uses sound contrasts that are useful in most languages. Even if the sounds are not common in your language they are still useful for improving temporal processing speed and accuracy. 

### Customize text label list
The lists below are the sound labels used in the English version of BrainHQ. These are used for the text on the response boxes. You can customize the labels if you think different text better represents these sounds in your language. Please send us a list of alternative labels. 

__Set 1__  
ga ka  
dee tee  
doe toe  
gee kee  

__Set 2__  
da ga  
et ek  
ud ug  
  
__Set 3__  
ad ads  
ek eks  
sa sta  
  
__Set 4__  
shay chay  
boe poe  
  
__Set 5__  
boe doe  
ab ad  
vo tho   
  
__Set 6__  
bu du

aff ath    

### Removal of sounds-pairs
If you strongly feel that a sound pair will not work in your language we offer the option to remove this pair from the stimulus set. Please advise which pairs you want removed. 

### Customize the tutorial text
You can also customize the tutorial text to include information about some of the sounds. You might want to add some text regarding unfamiliarity of the sounds. E.g., 

__Text key: aud_sound_discrimination_tut_01-0__  
You will hear one of two increasingly similar syllables and then identify which one you heard. Some of the sounds might sound unfamiliar but they are important for improving auditory processing.  Click on START to begin.
