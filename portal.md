Group Portal
==================

### Translation
We have discussed your proposals. Our preference is for group administrators to use our group portal to obtain information about their users. We were originally going to wait for our new text database before offering translations however, we have decided to offer an Italian translation by creating s separate list of text keys.  When these keys are translated we will use them to create your own portal site. We plan to use the URL: portal-neocogita.brainhq.com.

Here are the steps:
1. We need to pull out all the text in the portal and create text keys. We will do this within the next week. 
2. Once we have the keys, we will send them to you in a document for translation.
3. When we receive the translated keys from you, we will create the portal-neocogita.brainhq.com site and will include the translated keys. We should be able to to this within a week.


### Text keys
Please translate the text for each text key in [this document](portal_txtkeys.json). 

Do NOT translate any text inside HTML tags or inside curly braces. 
```
Here is an example of text that has HTML tags and curly braces. 
You're about to be charged <b>${{price}} </b> for <b>{{num_lic}}</b> annual licenses for the <b>{{name}}</b> group."
```
