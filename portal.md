==================

### Translation
Here are the steps required:
1. Translate the text for eachkey in [this document](portal_txtkeys.json). Please send us the translated keys. This is currently a manual process but we will eventually incorportate the keys into a new text database. 

Do NOT translate any text inside HTML tags or inside curly braces. 
```
Here is an example of text that has HTML tags and curly braces. 
You're about to be charged <b>${{price}} </b> for <b>{{num_lic}}</b> annual licenses for the <b>{{name}}</b> group."
```


2 We will set up a new portal app for your locale. Here is the format: 
portal-[locale-name].brainhq.com
