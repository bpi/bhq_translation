Group Portal
==================

### Translation
Here are the steps required:
1. Translate the text for eachkey in [this document](portal_txtkeys.json). Please send us the translated keys. This is currently a manual process but we will eventually incorportate the keys into a new text database. 

2 For each locale we will set up a new portal URL to pull in the correct translated text. We will use the following format:
portal-[locale-name].brainhq.com

Let me know if you have any questions.
