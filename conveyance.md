conveyance (True North)
=======================
You will need to translate the file names and corresponding text files in [this document](conv_stim.txt). The file contains list of colors, landmarks (stations), confusable stops, as well as transition words (e.g., first, then, next). 
##Format
"file_name" : "Corresponding Text"

You should also make a sound file corresponding to the text and name it using the file name. 

##Example
A station in the translated doc might look something like this:  
"arco_di_travertino" : "Arco di Travertino"  
Sound file: arco_di_travertino.wav
