# True North (conveyance)
This is a train travelling task where user must remember compass and stop instructions. We need translated dictionary entries and matching recordings. The stops should be culturally appropriate for the translated language. 

## Dictionary translation
We need a translated entry for each value in the dictionary. You can also update the key names but that is optional. Note that sound recording file names should match the key names (see Sound Recordings section below). 

Format:
```"key":"value"```

The key is the text before the colon. The value is the text after the colon.


#### Instructions
```   
   "take_the":"Take the",
   "train":"train",
   "to":"to",
   "first":"first",
   "trans":". then, ",
   "trans2":". after that",
   "trans3":". next",

  ```  
  
#### Directions
  ```   
   "w":"westbound",
   "s":"southbound",
   "n":"northbound",
   "e":"eastbound",
  ```  
 
#### Confusable stops. 
These keys refer to stops that sounds similar and are easy to confuse. Example: P Street, D Street, G Street in English. You should create values that sound similar in the tranlsated language.

## Sound recordings
  
  You should familiarize yourself with the existing English version of the exercise on www.brainhq.com. Once in the web app you can switch locales in the Profile section. The current translations for True North include:
  
  - English (female)
  - Portuguese (female) 
  - Italian (male) 
  - Greek (female) 
  - French (female) 
  - German (male)
  
  The voice can be male or female. The instructions are read out in a style that is typical of transit instructions that you might hear at a train terminal. 
  
  A recording should be made for each transated value. The sound file name should match the key.
  E.g., "fisher_lib" must have a wav file called fisher_lib.wav.
  Further information on recording is [here](recording_instr.md).
