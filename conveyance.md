conveyance (True North)
=======================
## Additional Text and Sounds
The file contains list of colors, landmarks (stations), confusable stops, as well as transition words (e.g., first, then, next). You will need to translate the file names and corresponding text files in [this document](conv_stim.txt). 

##Format:
"file_name" : "Corresponding Text"

You would also make a sound file corresponding to the text and name it using the file name. 

##Example
A station in the translated doc might look something like this:
"arco_di_travertino" : "Arco di Travertino"
Sound file: arco_di_travertino.wav
