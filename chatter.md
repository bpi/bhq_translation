Auditory Chatter
==================

### Stimulus planning
The lists below are the sounds used in the English version of BrainHQ. You will need to produce an equivalent set in your language. Once you have generated a potential list of stimuli to record, please send it to Posit Science for review. Once accepted by Posit recordings can then be made. 

### Four sets of recordings required. 
We require four different voices, preferably 2 male and 2 female .

### Stimuli
First adapt [this document](chatter.csv), translating directly where possible and making changes to the spec where necessary (for example, if it is not possible to specify gender in a confirmation).

Recordings should have similar rate and intonation patterns so that they sound reasonably natural when concatenated. A good approach is to have each speaker listen to a few appropriate productions of a model speaker and produce sentences as if in response to these sounds.
