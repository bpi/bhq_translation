Auditory Chatter
==================

### Stimulus planning
First adapt [this document](chatter.csv). These are the sounds used in the English version of BrainHQ. You will need to produce an equivalent set in your language. Once you have generated a potential list of stimuli to record, please send it to Posit Science for review. Once accepted by Posit recordings can then be made. 

Feel free to make the change the names to ones more appropriate for your local.

You can ignore the column ‘base Type’ -- it is a key used in the software and does not need to be translated. 

### Recordings
Three sets of recordings required - two female, one male.  
```
    Voice actor 1 [FEMALE] -- do all lines for speaker 1  
    Voice actor 2 [MALE] -- do all lines for speaker 2  
    Voice actor 3 [FEMALE] -- do all lines for speaker 3  
```
The sentences should be able to be joined together with the other speakers to sound like a natural conversation. You might want to show your voice actors the English version first so they get an idea of the tone they should use when recording the sentences. 

### Text keys
These two text keys are also needed. You have already translated them.
