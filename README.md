BrainHQ Translation
===================

###Overview
There are two types of content to translate:  
* Text: The text content is translated through a text database, then making the content live in BrainHQ. You should regularly (every week) check on the text database to ensure that you rapidly translate new text as we continue to improve and expand BrainHQ. Staying up-to-date in your translation is important, to ensure that your version of BrainHQ stays in sync with ours.
* Sound: The sound content is translated by recording a specific set of sound stimuli, and sending the files to Posit for processing and incorporation into BrainHQ. In general, you should have to do this only once per exercise.  

Many exercises can be localized completely by editing the text for your locale; others need translated sound stimuli. We can disable selected exercises for your locale until they have been fully localized.

### Text translation
All text to be translated is stored in our text database. Instructions on how to use the text database is [here](text_translation_instr.md).

### Sound translation
We would like you work through the exercises that require sound recordings in a series of steps starting off with a relatively easy stimulus set. More information is below. 

Recording instructions are [here](recording_instr.md).

## Exercises requiring text key translations
* divided_attention (Divided Attention)
* mot (Target Tracker)
* ufov (Double Decision)
* tapat (TAPAT)
* visual_search (Hawk Eye)
* vis_sweeps (Visual Sweeps)
* aud_sweeps (Sound Sweeps)
* eye_movement (Eye for Detail)
* visual_scan (Scene Crasher)
* face_match (Recognition)
* emotion_match (Face to Face)
* nback_card (Card Shark)
* digit_span (Juggle Factor)
* rotation (Right Turn)
* spatial_orientation (Mental Map)
* optic_flow (Optic Flow)
* task_switch (Mind Bender)

#### Text key translations plus additional requirements
* face_story (Face Facts) -- also require translation of [4 xml files](face_story).
* aud_sound_discrimination (Fine Tuning) - can also customize [button labels and omit syllable pairs] (tua.md)  

## Exercises requiring sound recordings 
In addition to the text translations, the following exercises require sound stimuli. We would like you to work through these exercises in a series of steps. Only when one step is fully completed should you move to the next step. A step is completed when the exercise it is ready to go live on our production server. 

###Sound recording - easy stimuli
####Step 1 
The sounds for the first two exercises (Mixed Signals and Auditory Ace) should be translated first. This is a relatively easy set of stimuli and will help us establish that the recording methods meet our requirements. 
* dual_modes (Mixed Signals). 
* nback_card_auditory (Auditory Ace).  

Please translate and record [this](easy_translations.md) stimulus set.  

####Step 2  
When the previous step is completed you can start working on True North. This is another relatively easy stimulus set.  
* conveyance (True North). Please translate and record [this] (conveyance.md) stimulus set.

###Sound recording - complex stimuli
Stimulus planning and generation is required for exercises with complex sound stimuli. Please contact us when you are ready to proceed with the next step so that we can start working together to produce a stimulus list. 

Note: Due to the complexity of the stimuli in aud_instr_seq (To-Do List Training) we do not plan to offer this exercise for translation. However, note that the conveyance (True North) exercise is a very similar task. 

####Step 3
When the previous step has been completed please contact us when you are ready to start stimulus planning and generation for these exercise. Note that both of these exercises use the same stimulus set.
* aud_spatial_match (Memory Grid)
* syl_ordering (Syllable Stacks)  

####Step 4
When the previous step has been completed please contact us when you are ready to start stimulus planning and generation for this exercise:
*  aud_chatter (In the Know).  

## Beta exercises  - do not translate
*  categorization (Categorization)
*  beep_seeker (Beep Seeker)
*  gabor_memory (name-gabor_memory)
*  visual_ordering (Fribble Factor)
*  visual_spatial_match (Fribbler)
*  lucky_seven (name-lucky_seven)
*  rule_change (Rule Change)
*  digit_span_auditory (Auditory Juggle Factor)
*  dualnback_card (Dual N-Back)
