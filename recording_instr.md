### Recording instructions

The words should all be recorded at the same careful (but not overly slow) rate with a neutral/declarative intonation. Recording should be done in a quiet, non-resonant room using a microphone of reasonable quality.

Recordings should be unprocessed and delivered in a single 16-bit, 44.1 kHz .wav file along with a text file annotating the contents of the waveform (including native orthography). If possible, a Praat (http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) TextGrid annotation containing three tiers (English translation, rough phonetic gloss, native orthography) would be preferable.
